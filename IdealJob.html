            <p><strong>Why this job?</strong> <br> Well, because this job ticks all the boxes for me. It incorporates
                all the
                skills and fields I want to spend my time developing. A few of the standout reasons I’m attracted to
                this role are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It requires innovative IT solutions; I thrive at critical thinking and problem-solving, so I believe
                    I will be pleased with a level of challenge.</li>
                <li>This is a consultancy role; working with others to make their jobs easier brings me genuine joy.
                </li>
                <li>This role incorporates risk management; I have a keen interest in Cyber Security so I feel this will
                    be a great opportunity to learn more and develop my skills. </li>
                <li>It also advertises opportunities to develop knowledge in cloud technologies, which is something I
                    think is critical to learn in current times. There are more and more businesses incorporating cloud
                    computing into their operations, so experience with cloud is a must have for employment prospects.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="panel-2">
            <p><strong>What skills are required by this job?</strong>
                <img class="panel-image" src="jobrequirements.png" width="400">
                <br>
                To be successful in this or similar roles, experience is a must. Familiarity with consultancy roles and
                a background in cloud computing, IT risk management, and IT infrastructure, are all highly sought-after
                attributes. To be considered suitable for this role one would mostly likely need to gain experience in
                another consultancy or managerial role.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-2">
            <p><strong>What skills do I currently have? </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear, concise communication skills, both written and spoken.</li>
                <li>An effective typist at an average 90wpm. </li>
                <li>Experienced in Adobe suite and Office 365 apps.</li>
                <li>Confident at multi-tasking and prioritising.</li>
                <li>Professional presentation and conduct.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p> While I have a few general skills applicable to many
                workplaces, I have much to learn and develop in the ways of field-specific skills and knowledge. I have
                proven to be adept at picking up new concepts and can adapt to new environments with ease; I am sure
                this will prove to be a useful skill in my education and professional endeavours.

        <div class="panel-2">
            <p><strong>How will I acquire these skills?</strong> <br> I have a general plan below that spans the next 5
                years. This may change some or a lot, most likely the latter.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Continue working towards my Bachelor of Information Technology, explore all the different fields
