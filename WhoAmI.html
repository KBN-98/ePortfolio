            <p><strong>What do these results mean to me? </strong>
                <br>
                The results are a good indicator of my strengths, weaknesses, and my priorities. The MBTI results
                declare that I am driven by curiosity and ask plenty of questions. Which is true, I frequently research
                for fun; if a topic piques my interest, I often am down a Wikipedia article rabbit hole before I know
                it. While I do not agree with everything it claimed, the MBTI type I was given has given me the
                opportunity to self-reflect on my thoughts and ideals.<br>
                The learning styles chart has not provided me with much clarity as I had hoped, with the of the results
                returning the exact same value. What I can take from this is that hopefully, I am equally engaged with
                all kinds of learning styles.<br>
                I am pleasantly surprised by the result of this leadership style quiz; I can strongly relate to each of
                the qualities they described. I strive to be both pragmatic and innovative while holding onto my
                authentic self. I believe the best way to manage a team is by empowering your team through both your own
                self-confidence and a genuine connection with them.

            <p><strong>How do these affect my teamwork? </strong> <br>
                My MBTI type of ‘Turbulent Debater’ I think is a crucial component to any team. I can use my social
                engagement strategy to challenge my team members in back and forth debate; this is a great way to
                analyse different approaches promptly. <br> My ideals as a ‘Metamodern Leader’ also come to play in this
                sense, balancing idealism, and pragmatism; I can push the team to new and better ideas. On the other
                hand, my prospecting nature can lead to forgetting details and impulsive decision making. I would need
                to keep in mind not to let my ‘hard and fast’ personality get the better of me in team decision making.

            <p><strong>How will take this into account while forming a team?</strong> <br>
                I tend to overthink and find it hard to focus or even focus on the wrong task at times. My turbulent
                personality leads to bouts of self-doubt and insecurity, so I think another strong individual to help
                drive progress would benefit me in a team. <br> I believe the qualities I have would benefit from other
                personality types to balance the energy I bring. I tend to get very driven and passionate in my work,
                but usually in short bursts. While I can push the team to explore innovation, I would need another team
                member able to keep me grounded to reality, and gentle reminders to consider other peers’ feelings in
                the process.</p>
