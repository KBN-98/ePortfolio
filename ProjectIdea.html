            <h2> Project Idea: Automating Open Cut Mining Blasts with Phase Shift Lasers and Cloud Technology</h2>
            <p><strong>Overview </strong> <br>
                To begin, the inspiration for this idea came from many a conversation with my Dad after coming home from
                his weeks on shift at the mines; he operates heavy vehicles and trucks as a relief operator at various
                mine sites in the Bowen Basin. This project idea came from concerns he has made regarding the safety and
                efficiency of current blast hole preparation and data management. <br> My idea is essentially a software
                and
                hardware package to automate pre-measures with a phase shift laser, integrating this data with existing
                software for calculations, and then a cloud-based system for automating the transfer of all data to the
                blast crew and supervisors. </p>

        <div class="panel-2">
            <p><strong>Motivation </strong> <br>
                Besides giving my Dad one less thing to complain about from a long week of work, there are many other
                factors which lead to me exploring this idea. By improving the accuracy of blast hole measurements,
                wastage can be reduced, both material and time; this will, in turn, save money. Improving efficiency not
                only helps profits, but it also helps the workers. The laser could be operated from within an
                air-conditioned vehicle, with little need to leave, by reducing the time operators spend in the sun,
                dust: it will lessen the risk of fatigue. The current operation is inefficient and causes unnecessary
                operator fatigue; it is even a Queensland government appointed initiative to reduce fatigue risks in the
                workplace. “There is a direct link between fatigue and increased risk of being involved in an incident
                or accident.” (Worksafe Queensland, 2015)

            <p><strong>Description </strong> <br>
                This project is designed to re-evaluate the way open-cut sites go about what is arguably the most iconic
                part of their operation, explosions. For those who are unfamiliar with the current process, the topsoil
                is loosened with explosives. Holes are drilled in a pattern and filled with up to 3 tonnes of
                explosives, then the blast crew essentially presses the button, and the shot goes off, all the soil
                falling away. See below video taken by my father on site of the shot going off.</p>

            <p>With my experience in the mining sector, I know that the most crucial thing for stakeholders is saving
                time and reducing safety risks. This combination of hardware and software can do just that, for the most
                integral element of their daily operations.<br>
                We begin with the pre-start measuring of blast holes; currently, they are done manually by workers in
                the sun and dust, with a handheld dip to measure the depth. Often, fatigue causes operators to lose
                focus, and measurements are recorded inaccurately. My idea is to automate this with a phase shift laser,
                like that from Dimetix. It can measure directly down into bores up to 500M and with 1mm absolute
                accuracy over the entire range. This measurement is not only accurate, but it is fast at 250Hz in and 1
                kHz output. These measurements can be recorded automatically and integrated with the existing software
                used to calculate ratios of the chemical explosives.<br>
                This hardware package would be accompanied by software, which will integrate the data sourced from the
                laser with the pre-existing programs used to calculate the required ratio of chemicals and density of
                the pour. During this process, outliers or abnormalities can be pinged to be further investigated using
                average min-max ranges for depths of charges. Once calculations completed and a suggested density
                suggested to the operator, the pour can be confirmed and commenced automatically as per usual. All this
                data will be immediately available via a cloud-based network that connects the vehicle and operator to
                the blast crew and supervisors.<br>
                Presently, all data and checks are done on physical paperwork by vehicle operators, which are then taken
                back to the office, scanned, filed, and distributed to those it concerns. My idea is to shunt this
                process into modern-day by locating it on the cloud. By storing all data from the laser and vehicles on
                a cloud-based network, it will be available as soon as it is recorded. That way mistakes if they should
                occur can be identified by supervising parties as they happen, rather than hours or days later. Not only
                will this speed up the process, but it will be more accurate; humans are prone to make mistakes, it is
                an unfortunate reality. Filling out the same paperwork by hand every day in and out will lead to
                careless mistakes. An automated database on the cloud removes the need for most paperwork altogether.
                Less time wasted on inaccurate paperwork is more profits and less fatigue.<br>
                In conclusion, this is a hardware and software package designed to reduce the risk of fatigue and
                therefore mistakes in operations, this project is designed to automate many manual processes and make
                the data available almost instantaneously.

            <p><strong>Tools and Technologies </strong> <br>
                The focal point of this project would be the laser distance sensors used to automate pre-measures. This
                technology is already available to us, and easily accessible, especially for mining operations with big
                budgets. The Dimetix line of laser sensors have explosion rated enclosures as well as other accessories
                to easily adapt the product to the harsh environment. The D-series laser sensors operate on phase shift,
                which means the transmitter and the receiver and both mounted right next to each other on the sensor;
                the signal bounces straight down and then back to the receiver directly, compared to say triangulation
                methods. <br>
                The other fundamental component of this package will be the cloud infrastructure; with the goal being
                virtualising this work environment for greater efficiency. By utilising cloud computing, the entire
                process will be much faster with fewer errors, and data will be instantly accessible to those who need
                it.

            <p><strong>Skills Required </strong> <br>
                A few different skills are required to make this project come to fruition, the first being programming
                experience. Integrating the data gathered by the laser sensors with the existing calculating programs
                may be difficult. I would need some prior experience before being able to produce satisfactory results.
                Experience with cloud computing will also be pertinent to this project due to the scale of this idea.
                With little to no existing infrastructure to build off of, there will be a lot of work to establish a
                new cloud database. However, both of these skills overlap in many positions, so gaining the experience
                and knowledge required should not be an exhaustive task.

            <h2>Outcome </h2>
            <p> It will be challenging to prepare for every possible outcome; a lot can go wrong on a mine site, and a
                lot of people’s lives are on the line, especially when dealing with explosives. But with enough
                experience behind me, I believe the success of this project could mean many things. Including an
                increased accuracy in measurement of blast holes, cutting wastage, and saving money for stakeholders.
                This project can also minimise operator fatigue, therefore reducing the risk of injury or mistakes. My
                main goal is to improve productivity and efficiency in this process while also keeping operators safe
                and healthy.
