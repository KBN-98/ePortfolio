			<h2> A little about me </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Born in NSW, raised in central QLD.</li>
				<li>My entire family is heavily involved with IT and gaming, we used to raid together in the MMO, World
					of
					Warcraft. </li>
				<li>I graduated in 2015 and since then have been working in sales and purchasing.</li>
				<li>I work in the construction and building supplies industry, with most of my time spent in mining and
					commercial sales.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>My passion for IT</strong> runs deep, you could say it is in my blood. Both my parents and
				siblings
				are avid gamers and tech enthusiasts. This undeniably moulded me from a young age into the person I am
				today; I thrive on learning and adapting to new technology, and have a passion for analysing processes,
				finding a better way to do something whenever I can. While I am enthralled by IT, I am also all too
				familiar
				with the safety concerns that it entails, I’d like to work towards a safer world of technology for
				everyone.

			<p><strong>Before applying for RMIT</strong> , I researched a lot of Australian universities, my main
				concerns being exciting course content and online support. Out of all the schools I had investigated,
				RMIT not only had performed well and ranked highly for STEM-related subjects but offered many options
				for online study. Also, there were many great reviews for RMIT from alumni, and also current students.

		<div class="panel-2">
			<p><strong>During my studies</strong> , I am excited to be challenged and to expand my knowledge as much as
				I can; I am expecting to gain a greater appreciation for IT and all its components. Information
				Technology encompasses a plethora of fields, some of which I am sure to have never heard of. Alongside
				exploring things I am already interested in; I’m enthused by the idea of fields unknown to me!
